# React Native FlatList Data Inconsistency Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using FlatList in React Native: rendering errors caused by undefined or inconsistent data.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, where inconsistent data in the `data` array causes the error.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a robust solution that handles potential data inconsistencies gracefully.  The solution involves carefully validating the data before rendering and employing conditional rendering to prevent errors when data is missing or malformed.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to run the app.
5. Observe the error in the console and the app's behavior.

## Solution

The solution focuses on adding error handling and proper data validation to prevent the FlatList from encountering unexpected data.  This ensures a more robust and stable application.
